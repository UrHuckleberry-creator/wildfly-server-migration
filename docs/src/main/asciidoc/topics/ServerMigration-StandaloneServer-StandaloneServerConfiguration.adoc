= Standalone Configuration File Migration

When migrating the standalone server configuration, the JBoss Server Migration Tool first copies the source configuration files to the target server.
It then updates the configuration to not only work correctly in  the target server, but also to take advantage of the target serverâ€™s new  functionality.
