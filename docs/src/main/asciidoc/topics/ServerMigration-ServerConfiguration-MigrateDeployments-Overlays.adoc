= Migrate Deployment Overlays

The migration of deployment overlays is a fully automated process.
The migration tool searches for deployment overlays referenced in the standalone server configuration.
It then migrates those that are linked to deployments that were migrated.

The migration tool prints a message to the console for each deployment overlay that is migrated or removed.
