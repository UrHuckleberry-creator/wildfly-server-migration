= Remove Permgen Attributes From JVM Configurations

The usage of `Permgen` attributes in JVM configurations is deprecated in {server-target-productName} and the JBoss Migration Tool removes these from all JVM configurations.

Upon successful removal of the `Permgen` attributes, you should see the following messages in the console:

[source,options="nowrap"]
----
INFO  JVM's permgen attributes removed.
----

If you prefer, you can set the `jvms.remove-permgen-attributes.skip` environment property value to `true` to skip the automatic removal.
