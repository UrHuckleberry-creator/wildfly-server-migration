= Remove Unsupported Subsystems

All subsystems, and related extensions, which are not supported by {server-target-productName}, are automatically removed from a migrated configuration.

NOTE: A subsystem installed in {server-source-productName} by the user, is also considered as unsupported by {server-target-productName}.

The console logs the configuration namespaces, and extension modules, of unsupported subsystems removed from the server configuration being migrated:

[source,options="nowrap"]
----
INFO  [ServerMigrationTask#5] Unsupported extensions removed: [com.example.extension]
INFO  [ServerMigrationTask#5] Unsupported subsystems removed: [urn:example:domain:subsystem:1.0]
