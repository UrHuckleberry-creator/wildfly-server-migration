= Add default SSL Server Identity to ApplicationRealm

{server-target-productName} default configurations include a SSL Server Identity for the default Security Realm named `ApplicationRealm`, and the migration tool automatically updates migrated configurations to match such change.

The following message(s) printed on the migration console and log(s), indicates this configuration update:

[source,options="nowrap"]
----
INFO  Security realm ApplicationRealm SSL server identity configured.
----

NOTE: The Migration Environment may be configured to skip this configuration update, by setting environment property named `security-realm.ApplicationRealm.add-ssl-server-identity.skip` as `true`.
