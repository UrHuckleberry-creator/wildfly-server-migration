= Migrate Compatible Security Realms

Because the {server-target-productName} security realms configuration is fully compatible with the {server-source-productName} security realms configuration, they require no update by the JBoss Server Migration Tool.
However, if the properties files are not referenced using an absolute path, the tool copies them to the path expected by the migrated configuration file.

This process is fully automated and requires no interaction by the user.
To skip the security realms migration, set the `security-realms.migrate-properties.skip` environment property to `true`.

Upon successful migration of the security realms configuration, you should see the following messages in the console:

[source,options="nowrap",subs="attributes"]
----
INFO  Security realms migrated.
