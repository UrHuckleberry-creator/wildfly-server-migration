= Managed Domain Migration

== Managed Domain Processing Overview

When tasked to migrate managed domains, the JBoss Server Migration Tool migrates the domain and host configuration files and their related domain content from the source server to the target server. This migration task is optional.

If you run the migration tool in `interactive` mode, which is the default, you are prompted to confirm its execution.

[source,options="nowrap"]
----
Migrate the source's managed domain?
yes/no?
----

* If you reply with *yes* or *y*, the domain migration proceeds.
* If you reply with *no* or *n*, the domain migration is skipped.

If you choose to proceed, the tool begins migrating the domain content of the source server. A cyphered repository used to store data, such as deployments and deployment overlays, that are referenced by the source server's domain and host configurations. Because the source and target servers use a similar content repository, the migration of this data merely consists of finding and copying the content between the servers. The migration tool prints the results in the console.

Next, the migration tool scans the source server for domain configuration files and prints the results in the console.

If you run the migration tool `non-interactive` mode, the JBoss Server Migration Tool migrates all listed domain configuration files.

If you run the migration tool in `interactive` mode, which is the default, you are presented with the following prompt.

[source,options="nowrap"]
----

yes/no?

* If you reply with *yes*, all listed configuration files are migrated.
* If you reply with *no*, you are prompted to confirm the migration for each listed configuration file:

Next, the migration tool scans the source server for host configurations files and prints the results in the console.

If you run the migration tool in `non-interactive` mode, the JBoss Server Migration Tool migrates all listed host configuration files.

== Customizing the Migration of the Managed Domain Configuration

Managed domain migration can be customized by configuring the following environment properties:

|===
| Property Name |Property Description

| `domain.skip` | If set to `true`, the tool skips the entire domain migration.
| `server.source.domain.domainDir` | Defines an alternative path for the source domain server directory, which defaults to the source domain server's base directory.
| `server.source.domain.configDir` | Defines an alternative path for the source domain server `configuration/` directory, which defaults to the source server's domain `configuration/` directory.
| `server.source.domain.domainConfigFiles` | Specifies a comma delimited list of the file names of the source server domain configurations that are to be migrated.
| `server.source.domain.hostConfigFiles` | Specifies a comma delimited list of the file names of the source server host configurations that are to be migrated.
| `server.target.domain.domainDir` | Defines an alternative path for the target domain server directory, which defaults to the target domain serverâ€™s base directory.
| `server.target.domain.configDir` | Defines an alternative path for the target domain server `configuration/` directory, which defaults to the target server's domain `configuration/` directory.
|===

The environment configuration may be done in one of the following ways:

* You can configure the tool's `config/environment.properties` properties file:
[source,options="nowrap"]
----
domain.skip=false
server.source.domain.domainDir=domain
server.source.domain.configDir=configuration
server.source.domain.domainConfigFiles=domain.xml
server.source.domain.hostConfigFiles=host-master.xml, host.xml
server.target.domain.domainDir=domain
server.target.domain.configDir=configuration
----
* You can configure the properties in your own custom properties file and pass the file on the command line using the `--environment` argument.
* You can pass the information on the command line using system properties. In this case, all environment property names should be prefixed with `jboss.server.migration.`.
