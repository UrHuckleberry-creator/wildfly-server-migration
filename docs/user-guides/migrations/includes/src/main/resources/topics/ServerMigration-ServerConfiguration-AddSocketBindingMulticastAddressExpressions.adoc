= Add Socket Binding Multicast Address Expressions

The {server-target-productName} default configurations uses value expressions in the `multicast-address` attribute of `modcluster` socket bindings, and the migration tool automatically adds such value expressions to migrated configurations.

The following message(s) in the console indicates the configuration update:

[source,options="nowrap"]
----
INFO  Socket binding's multicast address expressions added.
----

NOTE: The Migration Environment may be configured to skip this specific task, by setting environment property named `socket-bindings.multicast-address.add-expressions.skip` as `true`.
