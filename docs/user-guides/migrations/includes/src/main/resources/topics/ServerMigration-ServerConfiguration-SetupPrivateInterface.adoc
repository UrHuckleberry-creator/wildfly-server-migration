= Set Up Private Interface

The {server-target-productName} default configuration uses a new `private` interface on all `jgroups` socket bindings.
The JBoss Server Migration Tool automatically adds the new interface to migrated configurations with `jgroups` socket bindings, and updates these to use it.

Upon successful configuration of the private interface, you should see the following messages in the console:

[source,options="nowrap"]
----
 INFO  Interface private added.
----

If you prefer to skip the configuration of the private interface, set the environment property named `interface.private.setup.skip` to `true`.
