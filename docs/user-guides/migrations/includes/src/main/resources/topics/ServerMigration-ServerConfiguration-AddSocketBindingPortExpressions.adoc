= Add Socket Binding Port Expressions

The {server-target-productName} default configurations use value expressions for the `port` attribute of the following socket bindings:

* `ajp`
* `http`
* `https`

The tool automatically adds the value expressions to the migrated {server-source-productName} configurations.

The following message(s) in the console indicates this configuration update:

[source,options="nowrap"]
----
INFO  Socket binding's port expressions added.
----

NOTE: The Migration Environment may be configured to skip this conifguration update, by setting environment property named `socket-bindings.add-port-expressions.skip` as `true`.
