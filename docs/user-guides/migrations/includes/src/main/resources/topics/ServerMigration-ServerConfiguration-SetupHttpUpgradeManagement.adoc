= Setup HTTP Upgrade Management

{server-target-productName} management clients use the new HTTP Upgrade mechanism, and the JBoss Migration Tool makes all of configuration changes needed for clients to work properly with the migrated configuration.

The configuration changes are fully automated, and upon successful completion of the configuration, you should see the following messages in the console:

[source,options="nowrap"]
----
 INFO  HTTP Upgrade Management configured.
----

If you prefer to skip the configuration of HTTP Upgrade management, set the environment property named `management.setup-http-upgrade.skip` to `true`.
