= Remove the Unsecure Interface

The tool removes the `unsecure` interface configuration from migrated configurations, to match the {server-target-productName} default configurations.
However, you can configure the tool to skip the removal of the `unsecure` interface by setting the `interface.unsecure.remove.skip` environment property value to `true`.

Upon successful removal of the `unsecure` interface configuration, you should see the following message in the console:

[source,options="nowrap"]
----
 INFO  Interface unsecure removed.
